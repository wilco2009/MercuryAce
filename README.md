## THE CIRCUIT

### THE MEMORY MAP

![Memory Map|800](images/Memory_map.jpg)


### WORK RAM

![Work RAM SCH|800](images/WRAM_schema.jpg)

The work memory is where all program data is stored.

In a standard Jupiter Ace, we have only 1KB of working memory, although there are standard 16KB expansion modules that allow us to have 17KB of working memory.

The Mercury Ace has a jumper (J3) that allows us to select between 3KB of RAM and 19KB (1KB and 17KB of working memory, respectively):

- 3KB (1KB Work RAM + 1KB Char RAM + 1KB BG RAM)
- 19KB (17KB Work RAM + 1KB Char RAM + 1KB BG RAM)

The Z29 chip is responsible for generating the enable signal for the working RAM, which is located starting at address 0x3C00. There are three copies of the first K of this memory starting from 0x3000.

Z29 decodes A12-A14, and since it only activates when A15 = 0 (G2B), it is only active in the first 32K, providing an output for each region within these ranges:

- Y0: 0K-4K
- Y1: 4K-8K
- Y2: 8K-12K
- Y3: 12K-16K
- Y4: 16K-20K
- Y5: 20K-24K
- Y6: 24K-28K
- Y7: 28K-32K

The Z30C and Z30D gates are used to replicate the mirrors of the first KB of the working memory from the original circuit in the 12K-16K memory area.

A14 indicates if we are in the 8-16K area. When A14 = 0, they need to be repeated, so they are fixed to always access the same RAM.

- 3KB		/CE=!(!A14*A13*A12)

- 19KB	/CE=!((!A14*A13*A12) + A14)

### BG RAM

The screen memory or BGRAM resides in the Z5-6 chip. As we can see in the memory map, it occupies the address ranges 0x2400..0x27ff and 0x2000..0x23ff (mirror).

The logical equations that govern the chip are as follows:

Z29.Y2 = not (not A15 and not A14 and A13 and not A12)

R26.OUT = Z16.2Y2 + Z29.Y2


/WE1 = Z26.11

READING

 | A11  | R26.out | /WE1 | CE(CHR) | CE2(BG)  | OE |
 | -----| --------| -----| --------| ---------| ---|
 |  0   |   0     |  1   |    1    |   0      |  0 |
 |  0   |   1     |  1   |    0    |   0      |  0 |
 |  1   |   0     |  1   |    0    |   1      |  0 |
 |  1   |   1     |  1   |    0    |   0      |  0 |

WRITTING

 | A11  | R26.out | /WE1 | CE(CHR) | CE2(BG)  | OE |
 | -----| --------|------| --------| ---------| ---|
 |  0   |   0     |  0   |    1    |   0      |  1 |
 |  0   |   1     |  1   |    0    |   0      |  0 |
 |  1   |   0     |  0   |    0    |   1      |  1 |
 |  1   |   1     |  1   |    0    |   0      |  0 |

The screen memory is configured as a block of 32x24 characters, which represents 768 bytes, leaving 254 bytes unused at the end of this memory.

This block can be accessed for both reading and writing.

The address bus of this chip is accessed from the CPU through the Z15 and Z16 chips and from the video circuit through resistors R11 to R20.

Access from the CPU or the video circuit is managed by the /VHOLD signal.

In the table above, we can see the logic for chip activation.

The case A11:R26.out:/WE1 = 1:1:1 appears to incorrectly address the BGRAM and CHARRAM when the processor is accessing memory outside the video area, but thanks to the resistors located between the data bus and the BGRAM, priority is given to the WORKRAM and ROM.

### CHAR RAM

/WE1 = Z26.11

The character memory, or CHAR RAM, occupies the address ranges 0x2c00..0x2fff and 0x2800..0x2BFF (mirror), containing a set of 128 characters, which represents 128x8=1024 bytes.

The memory can be addressed both from the CPU and the video circuit, but the CPU can only access it in write mode.

The reason for this is that during reading, the address bus entering from Z17 and Z18 is connected to the data bus through a 1KB resistor array, and the output generated by the chip is also connected to the same data bus through another 1KB array. As a result, the addresses interfere with the output data, generating incorrect readings. 

One possible solution could be to make the resistance value of the first array (address) higher than that of the second array (data), giving priority to the latter. However, this would need to be tested to rule out any unforeseen consequences.

When the video circuit is accessing the CHARRAM, the address bus arrives via two paths:

- A4..A9 come from the data output of the BGRAM (D0..D6), which at that moment will contain the character being displayed.

- A0..A3 correspond to the scanline of the character currently being displayed and will come from the lower part of the line counter (CNT9..CNT11).

Additionally, bit 7 of the character code data coming from the BGRAM will be stored in latch Z27B. This bit will be used to invert the video in Z23D if the bit is 1.

Bits 0 to 6 of the character code from the BGRAM are loaded into the serializer (Z28) each time the three lower bits of the horizontal counter are at zero (CNT0..CNT2), and the pixels are output from the chip with each clock pulse, combining with bit 7 (inverse) at the Z23D gate.

### VIDEO RAM ACCESS PRIORITY

The circuit implements a priority system that allows priority access to the video RAM (BGRAM + CHARRAM) to the CPU or the video circuit.

![RAM PRIORITY|800](images/RAM_priority.jpg)

The video memory is duplicated in the form of a mirror in two memory zones depending on the value of A10.

The priority of access to the VRAM is different depending on whether we access the main block (A10=1) or its copy (A10=0).

When we access the video memory from the CPU (A14:A13:A12 = 0:1:0) (output of R26) and /VHOLD=1 Z15 and Z16 allow the address to pass from the bus.

If the access occurs with /VHOLD=0, the circuit sets the 2Y2 output of Z16 to 1, isolating the signals from the address bus and allowing access from the video circuit.

Once set to 1, the signal is memorized and remains in that state until /VHOLD is 1 again, at which point it will again allow access from the CPU.

Z29.Y2 = (A14:A13:A12 = 0:1:0)

 | /VHOLD  |   Z29.Y2   | Z16.2Y2 |   1G   | next 2Y2  | ADDR_OUT  |
 | --------| -----------| --------| -------| ----------| ----------|
 |    1    |      0     |    -    |    0   |     x     |    ADDR   |
 |    1    |      1     |    -    |    1   |     x     |     x     |
 |    0    |      0     |    0    |    0   |     0     |    ADDR   |
 |    0    |      1     |    0    |    1   |     1     |     x     |
 |    0    |      -     |    1    |    1   |     1     |     x     |
 


For /VHOLD to be equal to 0 A10 must be equal to 1, which corresponds to the upper copy of the video RAM. /VHOLD also activates a mechanism by which it implements a wait state in the CPU through the Z80 /WAIT signal to avoid interference with the video circuit.

However, if A10=0 (lower copy) we will not activate the /VHOLD signal and therefore we will be able to consult the RAM thanks to the fact that resistors R11 to R20 will give priority to the CPU, so in this case we will interfere with the display and may show garbage on the screen during access.

/WAIT = /VHOLD + Z29.Y2

/VHOLD = !VIDEN + !A10 (/VHOLD active (=0) when VIDEN=0 and A10=0)

### VIDEO CIRCUIT

The video generation circuit is based on two 9-bit counters generated with the Z9, Z10 and Z11 chips:

The horizontal pixel counter corresponds to the CNT0..CNT8 signals.

The line counter corresponds to the CNT9..CNT17 signals.

From the counters the circuit generates two main signals; LINE and FIELD.

The LINE signal (Z22.12) is activated to indicate the end of each line when the horizontal counter is between 320 and 351:

LINE= !CNT5*!CNT7*CNT6*CNT8

The FIELD signal is activated to indicate the end of the display of a frame when the line counter is between 248 and 255:

    FIELD=CNT12*CNT13*CNT14*CNT15*CNT16
	
![counters|800](images/counters.png)


Additionally, the VIDEN signal indicates when the rectangle containing the characters is being represented, delimited between 0 and 255 for the horizontal counter and between 0 and 191 for the line counter.
 
    VIDEN = !(CNT16*CNT15)*!(CNT17+CNT8)
 
 |CNT17    | CNT16   | CNT15  | Line      | Comment           |
 | --------| --------| -------| ----------|-------------------|
 |   0     |   0     |   0    |  0-63     | Part of VIDEN     |
 |   0     |   0     |   1    |  64-127   | Part of VIDEN     |
 |   0     |   1     |   0    |  128-191  | Part of VIDEN     |
 |   0     |   1     |   1    |  192-255  | Not Part of VIDEN |
 |   1     |   x     |   x    |  256-311  | Not part of VIDEN |
 
 | CNT8 | Pixel  | Comment           |
 | -----| -------| ------------------|
 | 0    | 0-255  | Part of VIDEN     |
 | 1    |256-415 | Not part of VIDEN |
 
![viden](images/JupiterAce_screen.png)
 
The display sequence starts with the pixel counter and the line counter being set to zero, a combination of bits from the line counter and the pixel counter determines the position of the first character to be displayed in the BGRAM.

1) To do this, the BGRAM is addressed with bits CNT3,4,5,6,7,12,13,14,15,16, which gives us the character code through pins D0..D7 of the chip.

2) The character code returned by the chip together with the three lower bits of the line counter (CNT9..11) are used to address chip Z7-8 and obtain the scanline with the definition of the character which is loaded into the serializer Z28.

3) Bit 7 of the character code (inverse bit) is stored in Z27B to be combined with the scanline bits through Z23D.

4) From that moment on, at each clock cycle, a bit of the serializer content is output through pin 13 of the same and is inverted or not in Z23D depending on the content of Z27B and sent to the display.

5) When the value of CNT0..2 is 0 again, a new character code is loaded and the first scanline of said character is started. This process is repeated, sending 32 characters to the monitor.

6) After this, the pixels corresponding to the right edge are sent.

7) From 320 to 351 (LINE) a SYNC signal (positive pulse) is generated.

8) Between 352 and 385 we generate the Backporch signal.

9) Between 386 and 415 the right edge is painted.

10) The counter is reset to 0.

11) The above sequence (2-10) is repeated for the next scanline up to a total of 8 (CNT9..11=111b) at which point we move on to addressing the next line in the BGRAM.

12) After displaying 24 lines (line counter=192) we move to the lower edge of the screen, generating the FIELD signal between the value 248 and 255 which causes a new SYNC signal. Additionally, an interrupt is generated in the Z80 /INT=0.

13) Finally, the upper edge of the screen is generated between 256 and 311.

14) When the line counter reaches the value 312 it is reset to 0 again and we begin displaying a new frame.

![Backporch](images/backporch.jpg)

BACKPORCH = !CNT5*CNT2 from the last SYNC


### ACE81 ADDON (only valid until build025)
![Ace81|800](images/Ace81.jpg)
What is the ACE81 ADDON?
The ACE81 is a small module that plugs over the BGRAM and slightly modifies the display control hardware so that it is capable of managing a display like that of a ZX81.
The ZX81 makes extensive use of the processor to generate video, to the point that about two thirds of the processor's time is spent on this purpose.
The JA is a machine very similar to the ZX81 in many aspects, but with video generation hardware, which makes the 3.2MHz at which it operates fully available for our program.
The idea (and design) of the ACE81 came from Pedro Gimeno as an exercise in what a ZX81 would have been like if, like the JA, it had had dedicated hardware to generate video.
Obviously it would have been a much faster machine (or slower, depending on how we want to approach it).
The idea is to run a ZX81 ROM on a JA, with minimal modifications to the ROM to eliminate the video generation part.
Comparing the video memory of the ZX81 and the JA we realize that their layout is practically the same:

Similarities
- Both have 32x24 characters
- Both are black and white
- In both cases bit 7 of the character code is "inverse video"

Differences
- The character set of the JA is 128 elements, while in the ZX81 it is only 64 because bit 6=1 is used by the firmware to detect the end of line.
- In ZX81 each line is terminated in a HALT (cod=76h) (33x24=792 bytes) while in JA there is no line terminator (768 bytes)

Based on these premises the idea of ​​Ace81 is to make the video memory structure the same as that of the zx81 when we have activated the ZX81 mode (33 bytes per line), maintaining the standard structure (32 bytes per line) when the JA mode is selected.

Apart from the differences in the display, there is a small difference in the keyboard layout that requires modifying the circuitry of this to maintain the physical order of the keys.

Physically the layout of the keys of the ZX81 is identical to that of the JA, however unlike the JA, in the ZX81 the physical layout coincides with the logical one, which makes compatibility difficult when using a JA keyboard with the ZX81 ROM.
To overcome this problem, the keyboard wiring must be modified and some additional logic must be added, which we have decided to include in a GAL to facilitate the design.

As I mentioned before, the changes are limited to the two lower half-rows (half-row 0 and half-row 7).

| half-row| ZX81		      | Jupiter Ace	    |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
|    0    | SHIFT   Z   X C V | SHIFT SYMB Z X C|
|    7    | SPACE SYMB	N M B | SPACE  N   M B V|

But that small change and making both modes selectable, implies important modifications in the keyboard connection logic, since it completely changes the structure of the half-rows 0 and 7.

The equations that control both modes are the following:

```
/** Logic Equations **/

   ZX81 = ACE81_ENABLED;
   Jupiter = !ACE81_ENABLED;
   
   ROW_SS = !((Jupiter & !ROW1) # (ZX81 & !ROW8)); 
   ROW_V = !((Jupiter & !ROW8) # (ZX81 & !ROW1)); 
   
   KEYB2 = !(Jupiter & !KM & !ROW8 # ZX81 & !KZ & !ROW1 );
   KEYB3 = !(Jupiter & (!KN & !ROW8 # !KZ & !ROW1) # ZX81 & (!KM & !ROW8 # !KX & !ROW1)); 
   KEYB4 = !(Jupiter & (!KB & !ROW8 # !KX & !ROW1) # ZX81 & (!KN & !ROW8 # !KC &!ROW1));
   KEYB5 = !(Jupiter & !KC & !ROW1 # ZX81 & !KB & !ROW8);
```

### Operation of Video RAM and Character RAM Paging

The video and character RAM pages displayed are independently selectable from the video and character RAM pages accessed by the CPU.

For example, if we switch to page 1 with command 0, all CPU accesses will be redirected to page 1 of the BGRAM, but the video hardware will continue displaying page 0. The same applies to CHRRAM.

This configuration allows us to write in the background to a page that isn’t being displayed and then visualize it instantly by switching the active page for the hardware with command 1, avoiding glitches.

### Operation of Hires Mode

The Hires mode works by using 6 pages of text simultaneously (or 7, as we will see later), the BGRAM page selected for the hardware (henceforth referred to as VIDEO-BGPAGE) and the 5 subsequent pages.
The addressing space will continue to be 1024 bytes (2400h..27FFh), so it will be the programmer's responsibility to switch pages to access the 6KB of video memory.
Since each page has a size of 1KB, it will contain 32 lines (32*32=1024 bytes).

If we use only command 1, the hardware will start reading pixel line 0 from position 0 of the VIDEO-BGPAGE. However, using the page offset command (111b), we can specify a starting position offset (sub-line) within the VIDEO-BGPAGE.
This offset will affect only the display, while CPU access remains unaffected.
For example, if VIDEO-BGPAGE=0 and sub-line=10, the hardware will display the memory content starting at page 0, memory position 320 (32 bytes * 10 lines), and ending at page 7, position 319.

This command can be very useful for performing vertical scrolling via hardware.

Below, we can see a map of the video screen in high-resolution mode.

![HiresMap](images/hiresmap.png)

In this mode, the hardware displays characters with only one pixel of height, so the character definitions must match the binary representation of the code. The hires mode operation requires a prior configuration of character RAM. Before switching to hires mode, we must configure the character set as follows:

The first 4 scanlines of the active 128-character set must contain 4 copies of the character code in binary, and the last four scanlines should contain the character code XOR 127.

scanline/Addr |    0    |    8    |    16   |.........|  1016   |
--------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
 Addr+0       |00000000 |00000001 |00000010 |-------- |01111111 |
 Addr+1       |00000000 |00000001 |00000010 |-------- |01111111 |
 Addr+2       |00000000 |00000001 |00000010 |-------- |01111111 |
 Addr+3       |00000000 |00000001 |00000010 |-------- |01111111 |
 Addr+4       |01111111 |01111110 |01111101 |-------- |00000000 |
 Addr+5       |01111111 |01111110 |01111101 |-------- |00000000 |
 Addr+6       |01111111 |01111110 |01111101 |-------- |00000000 |
 Addr+7       |01111111 |01111110 |01111101 |-------- |00000000 |
 
### USER RAM PAGING

The 512KB of extra RAM for the user is set up in 32KB pages that occupy the second half of the Z80's addressing space.

The active page is selected using command 101b followed by the page number. Since we have 512KB of RAM, we have a total of 16 32KB pages.

### SWITCHING THE ACTIVE ROM BY SOFTWARE
Immediately after a reset, or when powering up the system, the active ROM will be the one selected by the ROM selection DIP switches. The ROM can be changed by software using command 110b followed by the ROM page. We have a total of 8 8KB ROM pages, so we need 3 bits for selection (bits 0 to 2 of register A).

### ACE81 MODE

Under normal conditions, ROMs 6 and 7 are reserved for ACE81 mode. This differs from the ACE81 addon, where ROMs 4, 5, 6, and 7 were reserved for this mode.

In addition to the previous change, the Hires Add-on includes an option to disable this mode so that ROMs 6 and 7 become normal ROMs. To disable ACE81 mode, use the ROM selection command. Setting bit 3 of register A to 1 during the ROM selection command call will disable ACE81 mode until the next reset or until the command is used again with bit 3 set to 0.

## ASSEMBLY

![board|800](images/cloneboard.jpg)

The Mercury Ace project is sponsored by [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/)​. The high quality of their boards, the speed of manufacturing and shipping, and their high-tech process have greatly helped us achieve our goals.


Components that should be changed or should not be put in or changed during the assembly

- C4 – Do not place
- U2,R4,R32,R33,R34 – Do not place if SJ1 closes (video option)
- JP9 – Do not place if the Ace81 board is not in place
- SJ2-SJ9 – place if the Ace81 board is not in place
- R30 & R31 – Do not place if the Ace81 board is not in place
- D12.. D17 – install a 0R instead the diodes if the Ace81 board is not on
- JP17 - place always
- JP11 - place always 1-2,3-4,5-6,7-8,9-10
- JP12 - place always 1-2,3-4,5-6,7-8,9-10

We have the following options when building the board:

Installation of op-amp for video:

The SJ1 bridge is the one that will allow us to select whether to install the op-amp circuit or bypass it.

With the bridge open, the video will pass through the components of the op-amp and therefore we will need to install the following components:

-	U2
-	R4
-	R32
-	R33
-	R34

If you decide not to use the op-amp, you must close SJ1 with a drop of tin and not solder the aforementioned components.

Installing the Ace81 add-on module:

The Ace81 Add-On module is a circuit that is currently in Beta. This circuit modifies the Jupiter Ace's hardware to simulate a zx81, modifying the video generation circuit and keyboard order.

In the module we have a selector that will allow us to switch between Jupiter Ace mode and Ace81 mode.

If we want to have this add-on we must take in acount the follwing:

Do not install the following components: R30, R31, D12, D13, D14, D15, D16, D17, and Z40.
Bridge D12, D13, D14, D15, D16, and D17.

The JED file for the GAL(Z40) is available in the GAL folder.

Additionally, the Add-on board will have to be manufactured and connected on the pins located around the Z5-6 RAM (JP10x, JP15x, JP6 and JP8)

JP9 is an alternate selector on the main board for ACE81 mode, so JP9 and the Addon selector are mutually exclusive, so only one of them should be used, leaving the other one unset.

This mode requires a modified ROM for its proper functioning that is included inside the ROM folder.

The GAL must be welded without a socket as it does not fit inside the housing along with it.

If you do not use the Ace81 mode, you must take into account the following:

Install the following components: R30, R31, D12, D13, D14, D15, D16, D17, and Z40.

Close the JP10x, JP15x, JP6 and JP8 jumpers.

Close the SJ2 jumpers with a drop of tin. SJ9

## ROM

The clone allows to have 4 ROMs in Jupiter Ace mode and 4 ROMs in Ace81 mode, selectable from DIPSwitch S1. Pin 1 of S1 selects the mode (ON=ACE81 MODE, OFF=Jupiter ACE MODE).

The addon's mode selector will automatically switch between one block of 4 ROMs or the other, while S1 will allow you to manually select any of the 4 ROMs.

In the ROM folder we can find the following files:
- "ace.rom" - Original Jupiter Ace ROM
- "ace81.rom" - ZX81 ROM modified by Pedro Gimeno to work with the clone together with the Ace81 Add-on
- testrom.rom - diagnostics ROM made by Pedro Gimeno (https://codeberg.org/pgimeno/jupace-testrom)
- MercuryAce.bin - Contains all previous files in one unique file ready to be burned in an EEPROM.

## THE CASE

The clone case is based on an initial design by Cees Meijer, modified by him under my guidance later on, and some final modifications by myself to adapt it to my clone.

Many thanks to Cees for his design.

The Mercury Ace PCB is designed to be able to replace the PCB of the original Jupiter Ace, fitting perfectly into its case.

In the same way, I have modified the Cees Meijer model to be as similar as possible to the original case and also be able to house both the clone PCB and an original Jupiter Ace PCB.

The ready-to-print STL files are available in the STL folder. The case in the cover photo is printed in 9000x resin and I am very happy with the result.

The case consists of two pieces that must be printed in white.

For the bottom part we have two alternatives:

- The file "Jupiter ACE (bottom).stl" does not allow access to the DIP Switch of the selector so the aesthetics will be more similar to the original. We can leave the DIPSwitch uninstalled and the clone will boot by selecting the ROM recorded in the lowest part of the chip.
- The file "Jupiter ACE (bottom)(ROM selector).stl", leaves a window to access the ROM DIP Switch and the Ace81 selector.

For the keys we will need three printed copies of the file "keys (without space key).stl" and one copy of the file "keys (with space key).stl". This will give us the 40 keys we need.

The rivets needed are like the ones in the photo. We must look for them in online stores as nylon rivets reference R3100 to hold the PCB to the case and R3065 for those that join the two parts of the case.

The case stickers are available in the Adobe Illustrator file "teclado_cuadriculado v2 (1).ai".

We must print the file on transparent adhesive plastic and use a printer capable of printing with white ink. The blue background is for reference only and should not be printed.
